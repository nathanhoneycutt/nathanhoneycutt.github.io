# devLink 2013 Retrospective

I realize this is late now, but I've finally both recovered from devLink 2013 and (most importantly) caught up to the point that I can think about blog posts again. What a great time that was. I can't overstate how much I enjoyed devLink.

This was my first devLink (and obviously my first time presenting at devLink). I was clearly unprepared for the intensity of a three-day conference. By the end of the third day, I was worn out. I don't think I could have fit another nugget of knowledge in my head. I was lucky to attend some great sessions by some great speakers that were willing to share the vast knowledge they have.

For those that attended either of my sessions, thank you. I've posted the slides and notes for post sessions for anyone that is interested.
