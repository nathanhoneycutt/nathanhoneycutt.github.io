# Upcoming Conference Sessions

Conference season is almost upon us. [Codestock](http://www.codestock.org/) is coming up in mid-July and [DevLink](http://www.devlink.net/) at the end of August. I’m really looking forward to some focused learning as well as getting to “geek out” with some other developers.

If you haven’t yet signed up for [Codestock](http://www.codestock.org/), you should do so if travel to Knoxville, TN is possible for you. It’s a great conference with some great people, all for less than the price of a couple of books. If you sign up before May 15, 2013, the tickets are at a reduced price and you get to cast a vote on which sessions will be selected. If you’re doing that, I’d appreciate a vote for the sessions I’ve submitted.

* [Introductory PowerShell for Developers](http://www.codestock.org/sessions/introductory-powershell-for-developers/)
* [The Super-Simple Way to Write Your Own Cmdlets for PowerShell](http://www.codestock.org/sessions/the-super-simple-way-to-write-your-own-cmdlets-for-powershell/)
 
Since nobody said otherwise and the information is on the website, I’m going to assume it’s public knowledge that I’ve also been selected to speak at [DevLink](http://www.devlink.net/). This will be the first year where I am able to attend [DevLink](http://www.devlink.net/), but I’ve always heard very good things about this conference. I encourage you to attend that one as well, if you can make it to Chattanooga, TN.  It’s a little more expensive than [Codestock](http://www.codestock.org/), but it’s still a steal for three days.
