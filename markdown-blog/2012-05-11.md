# Come learn about PowerShell

Come see me at [CodeStock](http://codestock.org/) (June 15-16 2012) as I present my session “Introductory PowerShell by (Real-World) Example”.  This session is geared toward people that have no PowerShell experience, but I hope that even lightly-experienced users will get something out of it.  It’s a developer-focused session, so the theme is automating your work and finding problems.  I won’t be covering topics more suited to IT administration, such as Exchange or SharePoint administration.
